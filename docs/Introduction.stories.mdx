### Introduction

A few words about our culture. Code culture, as we call it. Culture between developers working together. The words describe an approach of how we can ensure a more streamlined setup across departments in DHI Solutions. Of course, there must be room for our individual preferences, but we must also keep in mind that we work in an area that is constantly evolving. It is therefore very important that we have a common toolbox, so that we can continue the development in a more efficient way. Together.

### Challenge

Writing code is creative. As professional developers, we can choose from a wide range of options when building digital products for our departments. Depending on our environment, we can choose between different programming languages, just as we can structure the codebase by different principles - or more precisely; design patterns. When working with team-based development - without any common guidelines - there is a consequence of an increasing imbalance between projects, teams and developers. Every step we take as individuals has an impact on the surroundings.

That being said, we also have to be very careful when trying to conclude a common understanding of how a team should structure, organize and write code. It is all about human resources that strives to deliver solid and well-crafted products - every day. We work hard to get better - and it takes effort from everyone to follow. We must retain the curiosity that made us write the first line of code - and share the knowledge we gain ever since that line.

### Solution

In a world of countless combinations of libraries and utilities, it is important that we stick together as a team. We have to work from a common understanding of how we organize our projects, so that we can deliver a more streamlined code across the departments, as well as improving the quality of our work. The procedure is open for discussion at all times, and there are absolutely no criteria for when we as colleagues can express our opinions.

We are a unit of developers who must be able to take responsibility for each other's work - but we need a common language for that.
