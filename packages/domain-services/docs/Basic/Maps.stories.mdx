### Domain Services | Maps

This package helps you connect to Domain Services and provides the instance that you can hook into.

1. Import the method:

```javascript
import { maps } from '@dhi-solutions/domain-services';
```

2. Use the getImage method to construct the URL for the image.

```javascript
const YOUR_IMAGE_URL = getImageUrl({
  bbox: '',
  crs: '',
  filePath: '',
  format: '',
  height: '',
  host: '',
  item: '',
  layers: '',
  request: '',
  service: '',
  styles: '',
  timestamp: '',
  version: '',
  width: '',
});
```

3. With the image URL in place, you can now render the image on top of the map.

```javascript
const YourComponent = ({ viewport }) => {
  const layer = new BitmapLayer({
    id: 'bitmap-layer',
    bounds: [-122.519, 37.7045, -122.355, 37.829],
    image: YOUR_IMAGE_URL,
  });

  return <DeckGL {...viewport} layers={[layer]} />;
};
```
